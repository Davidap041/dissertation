  abstract = {To respond rapidly to the highly volatile market, the emerging reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS) have brought forward two challenging issues, namely, how to build rapid a formal model of an initial manufacturing configuration and how to yield the goal model from the existing one along with manufacturing configuration changes (reconfiguration). As for the issues, we present in this paper a method for rapid design of Petri net (PN) formalized models of RMS, intended for supervisory control and logic control of RMS, as well as a method for automated reconfiguration of the models. Firstly, we present an improved net rewriting system (INRS) for dynamically operating net transformation, unlike its predecessor-net rewriting system, where the initial behavioral properties of the underlying PN rewritten can be preserved during the transformation. Subsequently, the paper proposes the three-phase method for rapid design of initial full PN models of reconfigurable manufacturing cells (RMCs). In this method, activity diagrams of Unified Modeling Languages version 2 (UML 2) are used to describe manufacturing configurations, firstly; then the sub-activity diagrams are transformed into PN sub-models; finally, the PN sub-models are automated synthesized into a full model by the approach of INRS. Further, we present a model reconfiguration method for this class of PN models. The method compares changes in activity diagrams of the existing and goal manufacturing configurations and converts them into net rewriting rules of INRS. By applying the rules obtained, the existing PN model can reconfigure into a new one for the goal manufacturing configuration. No matter the design method or the reconfiguration method, the behavioral properties of the obtained PN models, e.g., liveness, boundedness, or reversibility, can be guaranteed and thereby the efforts of verification can be avoided. Finally, rapid design of a PN model of a reconfigurable manufacturing cell, as well as its automated reconfiguration, is illustrated with the help of an example. The result indicates the validity of the methods.}

It is by far not meant to be comprehensive or inclusive, but to review through several representative areas a few of the conceptual issues studied in the literature. It was not possible to consider here the many domains of application were the Petri Nets modeling paradigm was used, among many others: manufacturing, logistic, hardware and software, protocols engineering, health management, transportation, etc.}

  abstract = {The changes in manufacturing practice towards increasingly flexible structures demand novel strategies for production scheduling and control. To this end, we introduce an automated model generation scheme that builds upon a coarse description of the production process and the factory. The generated model is based on a Petri Net representation of the production process, which we slightly enhance to separate automatically evolving processes from consciously taken manufacturing decisions. From the Petri Net model, we deduce a state space description which can be used for the synthesis of feedback control for the manufacturing system. The model generation is illustrated with an example, and further possibilities to utilize and enhance the model are discussed.}

This approach is based on Petri net to represent the discrete part, differential equations to describe the continuous part and object-oriented paradigm to deal with the complexity problem in real systems. During the modelling process, the Unified Modelling Language (UML) is used in order to support the description of different aspects and identify different hybrid characteristics of the system. The proposed approach is illustrated using as an example the design of supervisory systems for air-conditioning systems.}
